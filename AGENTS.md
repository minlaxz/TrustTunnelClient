# AGENTS.md — Project Guide for AI Coding Agents

## Project Overview

This is reposoitory TrustTunnelClient, which contains libraries and command-line client for TrustTunnel protocol. The protocol is compatible with HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, and QUIC, and supports tunneling TCP, UDP, and ICMP traffic. The libraries run on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

See [README.md](README.md) for full product details and
[DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) for prerequisite setup.

### Module Dependency Flow

```text
common ← core ← trusttunnel (CLI client)
common ← net  ← core
common ← tcpip ← core
```

`platform/*` adapters wrap `core` for their respective OS.

## Build Commands

Run `make init` once after cloning to set up git hooks.
Running `make` with no arguments builds all binaries (the `all` target);
`make help` lists every target with its description.

Every build goes through a CMake preset from `CMakePresets.json` — never invoke
`cmake` by hand, and never add a build flag to a CI script that is not also
reachable from `make`. The same presets are used locally and by CI, so a green
CI run means the same configuration built locally.

| Command | What It Does |
| --- | --- |
| `make help` | List all targets with descriptions |
| `make init` | Configure git hooks path to `./scripts/hooks` |
| `make bootstrap_deps` | Export AdGuard Conan recipes to local cache (prerequisite of most build targets) |
| `make setup_cmake` | CMake configure, skipped if the build dir is already configured (accepts `SKIP_BOOTSTRAP=1`) |
| `make reconfigure` | Force a fresh CMake configure, e.g. after changing `CMAKE_ARGS` |
| `make build_libs` | Bootstrap Conan deps → CMake configure → build `vpnlibs_core` |
| `make build_trusttunnel_client` | Build the CLI client binary (depends on `build_libs`) |
| `make build_wizard` | Build the setup wizard binary |
| `make build_and_export_bin` | Build binaries and copy to `$(EXPORT_DIR)` (default `bin/`) |
| `make all` | Build all binaries (client + wizard); the default target |
| `make test` | Run all tests (`test-cpp` + `test-rust`) |
| `make test-cpp` | Build libs → build test targets → run `ctest` |
| `make test-rust` | `cargo test` on the setup_wizard workspace |
| `make test-live` | Build and run the live (network-dependent) tests |
| `make lint` | Run all linters (`lint-md` + `lint-rust` + `lint-cpp`) |
| `make lint-cpp` | `clang-format` check + `clangd-tidy` |
| `make clang-format` | Explicit `clang-format` check only |
| `make clang-tidy` / `make clangd-tidy` | Run C++ static analysis only |
| `make lint-rust` | `cargo clippy` + `cargo fmt --check` |
| `make lint-md` | `markdownlint .` |
| `make lint-fix` | Auto-fix all fixable linter issues |
| `make lint-fix-cpp` / `lint-fix-rust` / `lint-fix-md` | Granular auto-fix targets |
| `make list-deps-dirs` | List Conan package directories (for finding dep headers) |
| `make compile_commands` | Generate `compile_commands.json` for IDE integration |
| `make clean` | Clean build artifacts |

### Selecting a build configuration

The active preset comes from `COMPILER` (`clang`/`msvc`, defaulting to the
host) and `BUILD_TYPE` (`release` → `RelWithDebInfo`, `debug` → `Debug`), or is
named directly with `PRESET`:

```sh
make BUILD_TYPE=debug all
make PRESET=clang-debug-sanitizer test
make PRESET=musl-cross-mips-relwithdebinfo build_and_export_bin
```

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `PRESET` | Preset to configure with; overrides `COMPILER`/`BUILD_TYPE` |
| `BUILD_DIR` | Build directory; defaults to `cmake-build-$(PRESET)` |
| `CMAKE_ARGS` | Extra `cmake` flags, e.g. `-DIPV6_UNAVAILABLE=ON` |
| `CTEST_ARGS` | Extra `ctest` flags, e.g. `-R <regex>` |
| `ARCH` | macOS architecture(s), e.g. `arm64` or `'arm64;x86_64'` |
| `MACOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` | Minimum macOS version, default `10.15` |
| `SKIP_BOOTSTRAP` | `1` skips the Conan bootstrap (CI does its own) |
| `SKIP_VENV` | `1` uses the tools on `PATH` instead of a local venv |

Presets available in `CMakePresets.json` (kept in sync with `native-libs-common`
and `vpn-cli`):

- `clang-relwithdebinfo`, `clang-debug` — macOS/Linux builds with libc++
- `clang-relwithdebinfo-sanitizer`, `clang-debug-sanitizer` — the above plus
  AddressSanitizer; the RelWithDebInfo one is what CI runs unit tests with
- `msvc-relwithdebinfo`, `msvc-debug` — Windows builds
- `musl-cross-<arch>-relwithdebinfo`, `musl-cross-<arch>-debug` for `arch` in
  `x86_64`, `aarch64`, `armv7`, `mips`, `mipsel` — statically linked Linux
  release builds, cross-compiled with `zig cc`. These are the configurations the
  released Linux binaries are built from.

## Code Style

### C++

- LLVM-based style, 4-space indent, 120-column limit (see `.clang-format`)
- Pointers and references: `*` and `&` bind to the identifier (right side),
  e.g. `int *ptr`, `const std::string &ref` (LLVM convention)
- Line continuations (wrapped arguments, conditions) indent 8 spaces
- No short functions/blocks on a single line
- Constructor initializers break before comma
- Binary operators break before the operator (non-assignment)
- Extensive static analysis via `.clang-tidy`, all warnings are errors
- Naming conventions (from `.clang-tidy`):
    - `lower_case`: variables, functions, methods, namespaces
    - `CamelCase`: classes, structs, enums, typedefs, template type parameters
    - `UPPER_CASE`: constants, `constexpr` locals, static constants
    - Private/protected members prefixed with `m_`, globals with `g_`
- Use `libc++` (not `libstdc++`)
- Use static storage duration instead of anonymous namespaces for internal linkage where possible
    - (e.g. `static const int VALUE = 42;` instead of putting it in an anonymous namespace)
- Function descriptions are written in imperative language
    - e.g. "Calculate the sum of two numbers" instead of "Calculates the sum of two numbers"

### Rust

- Standard `rustfmt` formatting, enforced by `cargo fmt`
- `clippy` with `-D warnings` (all warnings are errors)

### Markdown

- Linted with `markdownlint` (config in `.markdownlint.json`)
- Unordered lists use dashes (`-`), indented 4 spaces
- No line-length limit
- **Markdown table formatting (MD060)**: When the Markdownlint MD060 rule
  triggers, switch to tight table formatting with spaces. Example:

  ```markdown
  | Column1 | Column2 |
  | --- | --- |
  | Value 1 | Value 2 |
  ```

  Do NOT use extra padding or alignment characters beyond single spaces.

### General

- Prefer existing patterns over inventing new ones
- Keep changes minimal and focused
- Tests live in `test/` subdirectories alongside the module they cover
- Logging guidelines:
    - Use `DEBUG` level for verbose debug info, `INFO` for high-level events,
      `WARN` for recoverable issues, and `ERROR` for critical (unrecoverable) errors
    - Very frequent events (e.g. every packet) should be logged at `DEBUG` level, while important state changes (e.g. connection established, error occurred) should be at `INFO` or higher
    - Include relevant context in log messages (e.g. connection ID, error code)
    - Avoid logging sensitive information (e.g. IP addresses, payload data)

## Docker Debug Environment

The `.devcontainer/` directory provides a Docker-based remote debugging setup
(copy `devcontainer.json.example` to `devcontainer.json` to enable it).

- **Image**: Ubuntu 24.04 with clang, cmake, ninja, rust, conan, lldb
- **Purpose**: Remote LLDB debugging, especially for Linux debugging from macOS
- **Start**: `docker-compose -f .devcontainer/docker-compose.yml up -d --build`
- **Build inside**: `docker-compose -f .devcontainer/docker-compose.yml exec trusttunnel-debug bash -c "cd /workspace && SKIP_VENV=1 BUILD_TYPE=debug make build_trusttunnel_client build_wizard"`
- **Debug**: Connect to `lldb-server` on port 12345

See [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md#debugging-in-docker) for full instructions.

## Dependencies

Managed via Conan. Key libraries:

- **dns-libs**, **native_libs_common** — AdGuard shared libraries
- **libevent** — async event loop
- **nghttp2** — HTTP/2
- **quiche** — HTTP/3 / QUIC (disabled on MIPS)
- **openssl** (BoringSSL; MIPS falls back to `openssl/3.1.5-quic1@adguard/oss`) — TLS
- **nlohmann_json**, **tomlplusplus** — config parsing
- **cxxopts** — CLI argument parsing
- **magic_enum** — enum reflection
- **gtest** — unit testing

Local conan cache is populated by `make bootstrap_deps` which is dependency for many other make commands.

To find headers for **dns-libs** and **native_libs_common** (e.g. when
resolving symbols or includes), run `make list-deps-dirs` to list Conan package
directories, then look in each directory's `include/` subdirectory.

## Mandatory Task Rules

You MUST follow the following rules for EVERY task that you perform:

- You MUST verify it with linter, formatter, and C++/Rust compilers.

  Use the following commands:
    - `make all` to check if code builds (bare `make` only runs `init`)
    - `make test` to build and run unit tests
    - `make lint` to run the linters
    - `make lint-fix` to fix linting issues that can be fixed automatically
    - `make clang-format` to check the formatting

- You MUST update the unit tests for changed code.

- When a change is user-visible, you MUST update `CHANGELOG.md` under
  `## [Unreleased]` in the appropriate category. A required `CHANGELOG.md`
  update MUST contain exactly ONE entry for the PR/change: summarize the whole
  change in a single bullet, not one bullet per file or sub-change.

- You MUST run tests with the `make test` script to verify that your changes do
  not break existing functionality.

- When making changes to the project structure, ensure the Project structure
  section in `AGENTS.md` is updated and remains valid.

- If the prompt essentially asks you to refactor or improve existing code, check
  if you can phrase it as a code guideline. If it's possible, add it to
  the relevant Code Guidelines section in `AGENTS.md`.

- After completing the task you MUST verify that the code you've written
  follows the Code Guidelines in this file.
